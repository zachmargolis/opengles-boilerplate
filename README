OpenGL ES Boilerplate

There are a lot of conflicting OpenGL ES template files out there, and not all are easily extensible. This project aims to provide a flexible and extensible set of OpenGL classes.


Important Pieces
- EAGLView: is a UIView that takes an ESRenderer.
- ESRenderer: a protocol that provides a common abstraction for the incompatible ES1 and ES2 implementations
- ES1Renderer: an implementation of the ESRenderer protocol with methods appopriate for ES1 devices
- ES2Renderer: same thing, but for ES2
